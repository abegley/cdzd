About the Trainer
Axel Fontaine is an entrepreneur, public speaker, continuous delivery expert and independent consultant based in Munich.

He specializes in Continuous Delivery and hates complexity with a passion. He is the founder and the project lead of Flyway, the agile database migration framework for Java. He regularly speaks at technical conferences.

He is currently working on Boxfuse to radically simplify the deployment of Java apps, by turning them into ultra-compact perfectly isolated secure VMs within seconds and deploying them on any hypervisor with a single command.

Overview
------------------------
Continuous Delivery is all the hype these days. This training makes it a reality. We start with an overview of what Continuous Delivery is and how it can help you. We then quickly dive into the details. You will learn what it takes to architect a Java application so that it can be delivered continuously into production, with code, configuration and database delta, multiple times a day, with Zero Downtime.

Buckle up! This class is intensive and hands-on. You build an entire Java web app to the point where it deploys continuously, with zero downtime. We tackle the hard problems with a battle-tested approach you will be able to apply immediately.

If you are an architect or a developer and want to gain a solid understanding of the techniques you need to make Continuous Delivery and Zero Downtime a success, this training is for you.

Prerequisites
------------------------
This training assumes a good understanding of software architecture, the Java language, Linux and relational databases in general.

Format: Bring your own laptop and be ready to program.
